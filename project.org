#+TITLE: Project

* Define optimizers
** SGD
** SGD with Nesterov momentum
** ADAM algorithm
** ADAM with Nesterov momentum
** Adagrad
* Define datasets
# ** MNIST, Fashion-MNIST
# ** ImageNet/... image recognition
** /Audio recognition : UrbanSound8k/
* Define NN architectures
** Transformer 
** CNN backbone + LSTM + Linear Network as a head
** FFN + Attention / Linear Networks with Attention
* Metrics? Features to compare (characteristics)
** Convergence curves (during validation/training)
*** Convergence time (learning time, speed of iteration (iters/sec))
*** Theoretical (expected/actual conv. rate)
** Classification metrics during Test stage (mAP, PR-AUC)
